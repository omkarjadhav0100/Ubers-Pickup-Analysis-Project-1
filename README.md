# Ubers-Pickup-Analysis-Project-1
Uber Technologies, Inc., commonly known as Uber, was a ride-sharing company and 
offers vehicles for hire, food delivery (Uber Eats), package delivery, couriers, freight 
transportation, and, through a partnership with Lime, electric bicycle and motorized 
scooter rental. It was founded in 2009 by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, a 
successful technology entrepreneur. After selling his first startup to eBay, Camp 
decided to create a new startup to address San Francisco’s serious taxi problem.
In Supervised learning, we have a training set and a test set. The training and test set 
consists of a set of examples consisting of input and output vectors, and the goal of 
the supervised learning algorithm is to infer a function that maps the input vector to 
the output vector with minimal error. We applied machine learning algorithms to 
make a prediction of Price in the Uber Dataset of Boston. Several features will be 
selected from 56 columns. Predictive analysis is a procedure that incorporates the use 
of computational methods to determine important and useful patterns in large data.

The objective is to first explore hidden or previously unknown information by 
applying exploratory data analytics on the dataset and to know the effect of each field 
on price with every other field of the dataset. Then we apply different machine 
learning models to complete the analysis. After this, the results of applied machine 
learning models were compared and analyzed on the basis of accuracy, and then the 
best performing model was suggested for further predictions of the label ‘Price’.
